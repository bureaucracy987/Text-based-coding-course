    Birds have feathers that help them fly, keep them warm, and protect them from rain.
    They lay eggs in nests, which they build in trees, on the ground, or even on buildings.
    Birds come in many colours, like the bright red cardinal or the blue jay.
    They use their beaks to eat different foods, such as seeds, insects, and fruit.
    Some birds, like parrots, can mimic human speech and other sounds.</p>
